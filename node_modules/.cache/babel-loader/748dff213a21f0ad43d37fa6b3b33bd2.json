As the only designer present in the\n            redevelopment processes, I took it upon myself to ensure that the\n            solutions were usable, accessible and responded to business demands.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            The Auditor search service was done in React with Bootstrap and\n            custom styling I had started to redevelop on another project. It\n            reflected on a developing style guide and provided ideas for\n            improvement for the design system as well.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Official PDF-document templates</h2>\n          <h3>\n            Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus / Finnish Patent and Registration\n            Office Helsinki, Finland\n          </h3>\n          <span>Role: Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) didn’t have an\n            official document model that was used on digitally-generated\n            documents. The documents followed a simple automatically generated\n            format, meaning that they were unaccessible, unrecognizable and\n            subject to fraud. The documents would have to reflect PRH and their\n            documents’ official nature throughout their services from receipts\n            to registrations and patents.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            Together with another designer we designed a variety of document\n            templates that we tested in workshops internally in each business\n            unit that would be using the model. After, we modified the documents\n            to respond to workshop feedback, made the documents accessible to\n            screen readers and clarified the font usage and header levels, which\n            were then delivered to the technical team as templates and\n            instructions.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>\n            Design System - Bootstrap 4 -styles, StorybookJS, Sketch-library\n          </h2>\n          <h3>\n            Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus / Finnish Patent and Registration\n            Office Helsinki, Finland\n          </h3>\n          <span>Role: UI Designer & Developer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) partnered with us\n            to maintain, redevelop and redesign their custom Bootstrap-styling.\n            PRH didn’t own a systematic way of presenting the styles nor\n            instructing contractors and in-house developers how to use the\n            styles, especially with accessibility in mind. The custom\n            Bootstrap-styles had previously been developed by several\n            contractors, based on Bootstrap 3 and used widely on a variety of\n            digital services.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>I suggested building a component library for\n            developers and other stakeholders to use in their daily work on an\n            open-source platform (Storybook). As part of the development, I\n            redesiged the styling, fixed accessibility issues, created code\n            snippets and documented each component individually and maintained\n            the whole component library into an npm package. I developed the\n            styleguide on JavaScript and matched it with a Sketch-library from\n            scratch to support designers; a starting point of a design system\n            for PRH.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Brand & Communications Guidelines</h2>\n          <h3>Solidabis Oy</h3>\n          <span>Role: Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Solidabis is a growing software development company that has had a\n            variety of structural and cultural changes in its history since the\n            founding in 2016. The changes have led to the company not having\n            clear and concise image to potential clients, future employees or\n            the media. Logos and colors are not properly defined and mixed\n            versions of the logos are circulating around in workspaces.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>I developed brand and visual styleguide to help\n            everyone in their daily client work. It includes the correct color\n            codes, tone of voice, samples of text and imagery as well as proper\n            logo usage. I designed document templates for Word and PowerPoint as\n            well as other brand assets, such as an icon and font bank, Adobe CC\n            color package, social media hashtags and automated marketing\n            campaigns.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Designer on various projects</h2>\n          <h3>IBM</h3>\n          <span>Role: UX Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Due to strict confidentiality and the intellectual property laws\n            implemented in the contract signed with IBM, I am not allowed to\n            present my work to outside parties nor discuss the clients I have\n            worked with. A few of the Finnish clients which have publicly\n            promoted IBM’s cooperation, such as Finnair and Nokia, are just some\n            of the clients for which I worked for as a designer.\n            <h4>Focus</h4>All of the work I did at IBM was enterprise-centered,\n            focusing on enterprise-level users and employee experience rather\n            than customer and commercial. Most design work had to do with Watson\n            AI-powered chatbots for IBM’s clients. My tasks varied from leading\n            workshops, to user interviews and tests, to collaboratively working\n            with data scientists, developers and product owners on a daily\n            basis.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>University of Helsinki Metro Station Visual Outlook</h2>\n          <h3>HKL - Helsinki City Transportation</h3>\n          <span>Role: Visual Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Helsinki City Transport HKL organized an open call for artworks for\n            all the metro stations in the Helsinki branch. Participation was\n            anonymous and the submissions would be judged based on the artistic\n            value and historical implications as well as timelessness. Together\n            with a good friend of mine,{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"http://misaelrojas.com/\">Misael Rojas</a>, we submitted an\n            artwork for the University of Helsinki metro station, which is one\n            of the three busiest metro stations in Helsinki due to its location\n            near the governmental, private enterprise hubs.\n            <h4>Outcome</h4>The design takes into account the historical nature\n            of the station, being the last one to be completed in Helsinki in\n            the late 90s. Neon lights and tile patterns complement the station’s\n            spirit. We took nearly 300 images from which we vectorized shapes\n            from iconic buildings around the station. It gives the daily user of\n            the metro station something new to look for and spot in their\n            surroundings during their daily routines.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>#Olotila Street Art Collaborative Installation</h2>\n          <h3>City of Helsinki Urban Environment Division</h3>\n          <span>Role: Producer / Curator</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            In 2018 I worked as a Communications Intern at the City of Helsinki\n            Urban Environment Division. During the summer I noticed the largest\n            construction site of Central Library Oodi being surrounded by light\n            green wooden walls. In front of the Finnish Parliament, it is the\n            most central site in Helsinki. I gathered funding and organized to\n            get artists from womens’ collective Mimmit Peinttaa to cover these\n            walls with art and stories.\n            <h4>Outcome</h4>The walls were painted in early September. I made\n            and designed the promotional texts and logos in stencil form for the\n            city and companies. The works have appeared in many publications\n            such as Helsingin Sanomat and several Instagram accounts.\n          </p>\n        </S.textModal>\n      </S.layoutMainContent>\n
