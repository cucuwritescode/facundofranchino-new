During the process I kept in close contact with\n            both business and consumer users to listen to their needs.

The new election machines needed to serve time\n            well: use a consistent, well guided UX that is mainly used by\n            younger audiences on mobile devices on the app or browser. Use cases\n            would vary: from the urgent need for a candidate on the way to a\n            voting site to browsing heavily months prior to elections.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            From early on, the focus was on creating a platform that could last\n            time well so we developed an in-house solution that had hints of\n            gamification; tiny rewards for users to make filling the form as\n            easy as possible. The election machine consisted of three user\n            interfaces: the candidate machine, election machine to the voters\n            and results service for election night. Design-wise the style was\n            taken to monochromatic direction using as high contrasts as\n            possible, giving homage to Nintendo-style gaming experience where\n            user has a set of controls and where progress feels more like a\n            game, rather than a set of questions. The main focus was on\n            customization: making the use of election machine as fast as\n            possible when time is of the essence to being able to dig in as deep\n            as possible and answering as many questions as user wants.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Sokos ecommerce platform</h2>\n          <h3>SOK Design</h3>\n          <span>Role: UX Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            During my post as a designer for Sokos, I was in charge of designing\n            the whole UI for a new ecommerce platform.

The\n            old platform had met the end of its life cycle and thus, a new\n            platform was custom-made.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            After building a visual identity for the new platform, countless\n            Figma prototypes later, the goal was to create a beta store. In the\n            development of the beta store I positioned myself in several roles.\n            In close cooperation with the front and back-end devs we started to\n            add more layers onto the foundation built before. Using a design\n            system, for which I had built a theme using Typescript, we aimed to\n            scale the development and design to a more aligned model. From user\n            tests we concluded UX improvements that were done as part of\n            development. Alongside the ecommerce platform, one project that is\n            worth mentioning is the development of SOK Design System. A\n            rewarding experience in it was kickstarting work regarding a\n            consistent iconography with designers from several parts of the\n            organisation.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Website redesign & development</h2>\n          <h3>Solidabis</h3>\n          <span>Role: Designer/Developer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            The Wordpress-based website of Solidabis Solutions Oy had been\n            deprecated style-wise and technically, using a theme that did not\n            serve the users (editors) and viewers (potential customers, existing\n            customers) well. Bulky and heavy font selections, unreadable texts,\n            alignment issues and heavy load times were dragging the user\n            experience. Moreover, a few vulnerabilities in the the theme had\n            caused an issue for potential blacklisting of IP:s for frequent\n            visitors.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            As a solution, I redesigned the website entirely, using a Wordpress\n            framework (Genesis) for which I developed a child theme, to align\n            with the new styles and to give a brighter, more current look for\n            the website. I redeveloped the website using PHP with basic HTML5\n            and CSS/SASS to stylize the website. After that, I designed and\n            created new content for the website, including some iconography,\n            plenty of copywriting and photography.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Accessibility audit</h2>\n          <h3>Ruskeat tytöt</h3>\n          <span>Role: Accessibility expert (pro bono)</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Ruskeat Tytöt Media was updating their website and I offered to help\n            them out pro bono to respond to accessibility issues and identify\n            possible solutions to existing problems.

As a deliverable, I also provided\n            an accessibility report, found on their website.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Maintenance website</h2>\n          <h3>\n            Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus / Finnish Patent and Registration\n            Office Helsinki, Finland\n          </h3>\n          <span>Role: UI Designer & Developer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) needed a website\n            that would go online in the case of a service outage, maintenance\n            break or any other unexpected event. The website would need to have\n            three pages in Finnish, English and Swedish: front page, a list of\n            unaffected services and contact information page, editable in\n            Dreamweaver. The goal is to portray a message, that the service\n            outage is temporary and will be fixed as soon as possible.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            Using custom Bootstrap styling from the other project I had\n            developed for PRH, I designed the page entity that responded to the\n            aforementioned challenges. The page entity was a Bootstrap 4-powered\n            website that would be customizable by the PRH communications\n            department. I designed the elements and outlined the page which then\n            complemented the style guide as an example page as well.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Edunsaaja-apuri accessibility fixes</h2>\n          <h3>\n            Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus / Finnish Patent and Registration\n            Office Helsinki, Finland\n          </h3>\n          <span>Role: UI Designer & Developer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Edunsaaja-apuri can be used to determine if an entity is entitled to\n            benefits or required for providing extra information.

However, the bid didn’t include any designers but only\n            process and software developers. As the only designer present in the\n            redevelopment processes, I took it upon myself to ensure that the\n            solutions were usable, accessible and responded to business demands.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            The Auditor search service was done in React with Bootstrap and\n            custom styling I had started to redevelop on another project.

The documents followed a simple automatically generated\n            format, meaning that they were unaccessible, unrecognizable and\n            subject to fraud. The documents would have to reflect PRH and their\n            documents’ official nature throughout their services from receipts\n            to registrations and patents.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>\n            Together with another designer we designed a variety of document\n            templates that we tested in workshops internally in each business\n            unit that would be using the model. After, we modified the documents\n            to respond to workshop feedback, made the documents accessible to\n            screen readers and clarified the font usage and header levels, which\n            were then delivered to the technical team as templates and\n            instructions.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>\n            Design System - Bootstrap 4 -styles, StorybookJS, Sketch-library\n          </h2>\n          <h3>\n            Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus / Finnish Patent and Registration\n            Office Helsinki, Finland\n          </h3>\n          <span>Role: UI Designer & Developer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) partnered with us\n            to maintain, redevelop and redesign their custom Bootstrap-styling.\n            PRH didn’t own a systematic way of presenting the styles nor\n            instructing contractors and in-house developers how to use the\n            styles, especially with accessibility in mind. The custom\n            Bootstrap-styles had previously been developed by several\n            contractors, based on Bootstrap 3 and used widely on a variety of\n            digital services.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>I suggested building a component library for\n            developers and other stakeholders to use in their daily work on an\n            open-source platform (Storybook). As part of the development, I\n            redesiged the styling, fixed accessibility issues, created code\n            snippets and documented each component individually and maintained\n            the whole component library into an npm package. I developed the\n            styleguide on JavaScript and matched it with a Sketch-library from\n            scratch to support designers; a starting point of a design system\n            for PRH.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Brand & Communications Guidelines</h2>\n          <h3>Solidabis Oy</h3>\n          <span>Role: Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Solidabis is a growing software development company that has had a\n            variety of structural and cultural changes in its history since the\n            founding in 2016. The changes have led to the company not having\n            clear and concise image to potential clients, future employees or\n            the media. Logos and colors are not properly defined and mixed\n            versions of the logos are circulating around in workspaces.\n            <h4>Solution</h4>I developed brand and visual styleguide to help\n            everyone in their daily client work. It includes the correct color\n            codes, tone of voice, samples of text and imagery as well as proper\n            logo usage. I designed document templates for Word and PowerPoint as\n            well as other brand assets, such as an icon and font bank, Adobe CC\n            color package, social media hashtags and automated marketing\n            campaigns.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>Designer on various projects</h2>\n          <h3>IBM</h3>\n          <span>Role: UX Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Due to strict confidentiality and the intellectual property laws\n            implemented in the contract signed with IBM, I am not allowed to\n            present my work to outside parties nor discuss the clients I have\n            worked with. A few of the Finnish clients which have publicly\n            promoted IBM’s cooperation, such as Finnair and Nokia, are just some\n            of the clients for which I worked for as a designer.\n            <h4>Focus</h4>All of the work I did at IBM was enterprise-centered,\n            focusing on enterprise-level users and employee experience rather\n            than customer and commercial. Most design work had to do with Watson\n            AI-powered chatbots for IBM’s clients. My tasks varied from leading\n            workshops, to user interviews and tests, to collaboratively working\n            with data scientists, developers and product owners on a daily\n            basis.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>University of Helsinki Metro Station Visual Outlook</h2>\n          <h3>HKL - Helsinki City Transportation</h3>\n          <span>Role: Visual Designer</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            Helsinki City Transport HKL organized an open call for artworks for\n            all the metro stations in the Helsinki branch.

Together\n            with a good friend of mine,{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"http://misaelrojas.com/\">Misael Rojas</a>, we submitted an\n            artwork for the University of Helsinki metro station, which is one\n            of the three busiest metro stations in Helsinki due to its location\n            near the governmental, private enterprise hubs.\n            <h4>Outcome</h4>The design takes into account the historical nature\n            of the station, being the last one to be completed in Helsinki in\n            the late 90s. Neon lights and tile patterns complement the station’s\n            spirit. We took nearly 300 images from which we vectorized shapes\n            from iconic buildings around the station. It gives the daily user of\n            the metro station something new to look for and spot in their\n            surroundings during their daily routines.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h2>#Olotila Street Art Collaborative Installation</h2>\n          <h3>City of Helsinki Urban Environment Division</h3>\n          <span>Role: Producer / Curator</span>\n          <p>\n            <h4>Background</h4>\n            In 2018 I worked as a Communications Intern at the City of Helsinki\n            Urban Environment Division. During the summer I noticed the largest\n            construction site of Central Library Oodi being surrounded by light\n            green wooden walls. In front of the Finnish Parliament, it is the\n            most central site in Helsinki. I gathered funding and organized to\n            get artists from womens’ collective Mimmit Peinttaa to cover these\n            walls with art and stories.\n            <h4>Outcome</h4>The walls were painted in early September. I made\n            and designed the promotional texts and logos in stencil form for the\n            city and companies.
